## Description (about 100 words)

>Our app will allow for individuals interested in hiking to find like-minded individuals for adventures on local trails. Our motivation behind this application is to get people outdoors and meet new people! Our goals include allowing users to make connections to other users, allowing users to find experienced people of particular trails to increase confidence in case of uneasiness in their ability to hike a more difficult trail, and increasing the number of people utilizing public trails and spreading awareness of NC wildlife. Some features of our app will include a map of local trails to the Piedmont area, a chatroom based on interest in a particular trail/park, and possibly wildlife information.
